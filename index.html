                  The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
                  Francisco, California. The band consists of lead vocalist
                  Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green,
                  bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band
                  achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
                  drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
                  other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony,
                  The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed
                  even further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.

                <p class="article__text">
                  From there, the band has soared, gaining international
                  recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts.
                  New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and
                  organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
                  hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
                  affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn
                  to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking
                  forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently
                  recording their second studio album, looking to be released in
                  late 2021.
